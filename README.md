# Hour Booster

Hour Booster is a small project created out of pure boredom. Its goal is to enable you to farm hours using the game ID.

## Details

This project primarily depends on the package available at [steamworks.js](https://github.com/ceifa/steamworks.js).

While the package offers extensive capabilities beyond farming hours, such as accessing Steam user information, interacting with friends, and more, this project simplifies the usage to its core functionality: automating hour farming for Steam games.
